      <h3>Why is childhood obesity a social issue?</h3>
      <p>
        Chilhood obesity may have impact when the child is not only a kid, but
        also affect them when they are an adult
      </p>
      <p  class="exp_desc">
        Childhood obesity occurs when children are not eating healthy food and
        having beverages like coke, pepsi, etc. (not water) which is bad because
        the fatty food not burnt is accumilated in the body which if accumilated
        a lot, then will affect the child's performance in sports and other
        physical activities, hence being not the best practise for
        cardiovascular fitness(for the heart) which mat cause heart diseases
        like cardiovascular arrest(heart attack). In addition to that, it is a
        culprit for hypertension cancer, gall bladder diseases, etc.
      </p>
      <p  class="exp_desc">
        BUT there is a happy news!!
        <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> These diseases can be
        avoided by eating healthy food and excercising or be phisically active
        regularly like playing(on the playground) for about an hour. So, it is
        fun for fun and healthy for healthy! It is a bargain if you ask the
        doctors. If during a pandemic (which is in 2021) you can excercise for
        about 30 mins like jumping jacks, push-ups or just jogging around the
        house. Wanna know if you are overweight, healthy weight or obese?
